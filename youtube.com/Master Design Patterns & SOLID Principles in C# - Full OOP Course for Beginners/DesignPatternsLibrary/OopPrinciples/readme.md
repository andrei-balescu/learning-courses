# Encapsulation
Bundling data, attributes, fields, methods into a single class and limiting direct access to the data.

# Abstraction
Reduce complexity by hiding unnecesary details.

# Inheritance
Create new classes (subclasses or derived classes) based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes). Subclasses inherit properties and behavior from their superclasses and can also add new features or override existing ones. Inheritance is often described in terms of an "is-a" relationship.
