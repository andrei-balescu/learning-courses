# SOLID Principles
- S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

# Single Responsibility Principle
A class should only have one reason to change, meaning that it should have one responsibility or purpose.

# Open / Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

# Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

# Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

# Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
