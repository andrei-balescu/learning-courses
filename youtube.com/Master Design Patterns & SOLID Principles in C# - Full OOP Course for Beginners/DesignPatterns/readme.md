# Design Patterns

There are three main groups of design patterns:
- Creational: the different ways to create objects
- Structural: the relationships between those objects
- Behavioral: the interaction or communication between those objects

# Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral Design Patterns focus on how objects interact with each other and how they communicate to acomplish specific tasks. These patterns address communication, responsibility, and algorythmic issues in object-oriented software design. They help defining clear and efficient communication between objects and classes.

These patterns help in making design more flexible, extensible and maintainable by promoting better communication and separation of concerns between objects and classes in the system. Each pattern addresses specific design issues and provides a standardised solution to common problems encountered in software development.

## Memento Pattern
The memento pattern is used to restore an object to a previous state.

A common use case for the Memento Patternis when implementing an undo feature. For example most text editors have undo features where you can undo actions by pressing Ctrl + Z.

**When to use the Memento Pattern**
The memento pattern can be used when you want to produce snapshots of an object's state to be able to restore an object to a previous state. It is commonly used for implementing the undo feature and so provides a common solution that a team of developers can quickly understand and get on the same page with.

**Pros and cons of the Memento Pattern**
- You can simplify the originator's code by letting the caretaker maintain the history of the originator's state. satisfying the Single Responsibility Principle
- The app might consume a lot of memory if lots of mementos are created.
