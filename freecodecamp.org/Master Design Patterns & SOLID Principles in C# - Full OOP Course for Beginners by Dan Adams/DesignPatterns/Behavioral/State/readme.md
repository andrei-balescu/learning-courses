# State Pattern
The state pattern allows an object to behave differremtly depending on the state that it is in.

**Example**: Say you're writing a blog post using the popular content management system, Wordpress. The document or post can be in one of these 3 states:
1. Draft
2. Moderation (under review by admin)
3. Published
There are three types of user roles:
1. Reader
2. Editor
3. Admin
Only admins can publish documents.

The State Pattern suggests that we should create state classes for each possible state and extract state specific logic into these classes.

The `Document` (class) will store a reference to one of these states to represent the state that it is currently in. Then the `Document`, instead of implementing state specific behavior by itself, it delegates the state specific work to the state object that it has reference to.

**When to use the State Pattern**
When you have a class that behaves differently depending on state and you have a large number of conditions.

**Pros and cons of the state pattern**
- improves readability and simplicity of the context class
- satisfies the Single Responsability principle by delegating state logic
- satisfies the Open / Closed principle as new states can be added without modifying existing ones
- (con) can be overkill for simple state logic or if the logic rarely changes
- (con) _WARNING_: risk of exposing aspects of the internal logic of the context class publicly: use dependency inversion
