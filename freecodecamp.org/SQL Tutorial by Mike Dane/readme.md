## Database Management Systems
DBMS - a special software program that helps users create and maintain a database
- Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information
- Handles security
- Backups
- Importing/exporting data
- Concurrency
- Interacts with software applications

### C.R.U.D.
The main operations for working with a database:
- Create
- Read/Retrieve
- Update
- Delete

## Database types
### Relational databases (SQL)
Organize data into one or more tables
- Each table has columns and rows
- A unique key identifies each row

Student table
|*ID#   |Name   |Major      |
|--     |--     |--         |
|1      |Jack   |Biology    |
|2      |Kate   |Sociology  |
|3      |Claire |English    |
|4      |John   |Chemistry  |

### Non-relational (noSQL / not just SQL)
Organize data is anything but a traditional table
- Key-value stores
- Documents (JSON, XML etc,)
- Graphs
- Flexible tables
