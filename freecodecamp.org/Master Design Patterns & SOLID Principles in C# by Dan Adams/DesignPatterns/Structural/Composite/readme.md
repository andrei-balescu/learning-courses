# Composite Pattern
The Composite pattern is a design pattern that enables creation of tree-like sructures to represent collections of objects, where voth individual objects and groups of objects are treated in a unified manner.

**Exapmple**: Let's say that we geet an Amazon delivery of a large package that contains multiple items organized in smaller packages. Say we need to find the total price of the items within any package.

**When to use**
The composite pattern is useful for representing tree structures, i.e.
- Files and folders
- A graphical editor that allows you to group shapes together and apply modifications on entire groups as well as individual shapes
