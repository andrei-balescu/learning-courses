# Structural Patterns
Structural Design patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures and systems. These patterns primarely deal with how classes and objects can be combined to form larger, more complex structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. The key objective of structural patterns is to provide solutions to design problems related to object composition and structure, allowing for better organization and management of code.

Structural design patterns help to achieve several important goals in software development:
- Promote code reusability and modularity by defining clear and standardized ways to compose and organize classes and objects. This makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable over time, as changes or additions to the system can be made more easily.
- Enhance flexibility and extensibility by allowing the system's structure to evolve without requiring major changes to the existing code. This is achieved by decoupling the components of the system and promoting loose coupling of different parts.
- Improve performance and resource utilization by optimizing the way objects interact and collaborate with the system, thereby enhancing the overall system efficiency.

Overall these patterns contribute to building robust, adaptable and well-organized software systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time
